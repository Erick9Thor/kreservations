✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the application

There are two apps in this workspace of NX.

- kreservations (FrontEnd SAP)
- Kreservations (NestJS simple backEnd with SQLlite as BD)

Both have their Dockerfile with which they can launch the corresponding containers.

In the root of the project, you will find the docker-compose file that allows you to do this. So, to speed things up, simply use docker-compose up -d.

Another option if you want to use in local with angular server and NS webpack just do the following steps:

npm i

Run `npx nx serve kreservations` to start the frontEnd part
Run in other terminal `npx nx serve kreservations-back` to start the NS simulated backEnd

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build kreservations` to build the application.
Run `npx nx build kreservations-back` to build the application.

Or `npx nx run-many -t kreservations kreservations-back` but this option is worth because all logs ar mixed

The build artifacts are stored in the output directory `dist/`, ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t kreservations kreservations-back
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
